# To do -list

This will definitely be the greatest to do -list, powered by C#.

This project is still at an early phase!

With this project I'm going to get used to object oriented programming and consolidate my knowledge of C#. I use Forms App to have a nice GUI. Forms App has a toolbox that creates the template code for component objects, but the values need to be changed. Also the event handlers need to written by hand.
