# To do -list

This will definitely be the greatest to do -list, powered by C#.

This project is still at an early phase!

With this project I'm getting used to object oriented programming and consolidating my knowledge of C#. 

I use Forms App so I can have a nice GUI for the to do -list. 

Forms App has a toolbox which creates the template code for component objects (it's easy to select items from the toolbox and drop them on the form), but the values have to be changed for custom styling and all the event handling and variable manipulation needs to be written by hand.

This is a great small project for those who want to get started with C# programming and like to see changes in real-time without having to compile the project files all the time. This project can also be turned into a larger app with a host of different functionalities.

# Planned improvements

* Multiselection for list-items
* Linebreaks addition for textbox and list-items
* Attach Enter-key to 'Add new task' -events
* More text boxes, some of which have dynamic descriptions based on user events
* Background image and other style improvements?
